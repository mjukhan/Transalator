/// ParsedText : "Probleml: Designing a Comprehensive Adverse Media Detection System\r\nIntroduction:\r\nAdverse media, also known as negative news or negative press, refers to unfavorable information\r\nabout an individual or organization that is published across various media outlets. This information\r\ncan impact reputations and is critical for risk management, compliance checks, and due diligence\r\nprocesses. Detecting adverse media involves sifting through vast amounts of data to find relevant\r\narticles that could indicate potential risks associated with an entity.\r\nObjective:\r\nDesign a system that accepts an entity's name as input and returns all relevant news articles with\r\nsentiment scores, specifically identifying adverse media related to that entity.
